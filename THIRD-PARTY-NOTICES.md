# Third-party notices

Cycle bundles a parser runtime and twelve grammars so that installation needs no compiler and no
network. Every one of them is MIT licensed. The permission notice below applies to all of them, and
the copyright holders are listed per component.

## Bundled-byte provenance

`vendor/manifest.json` records the exact SHA-256 of every bundled file. These bytes were imported
unchanged from the clean Cycle for Claude Code baseline
`7eae1f52de25695d2ffbdc7b362396730e2d5e89`; the T03 verification suite rejects a missing,
additional, or modified vendor artifact.

## What is not recorded here

The vendored files carry no version or commit metadata, and nothing in the build records where they
were taken from. The licences above were read from each project's current LICENSE file, and every
one of them has been MIT for the life of the project. Pinning the exact upstream revision of each
bundled artifact is open work, and until it is done this file names the projects rather than the
revisions.
