/**
 * What a change can reach, and — the part that matters more — how sure of that we are.
 *
 * The reach feeds the evidence policy, never the routing: adding paths to the set the gate rules
 * are matched against can only insert gates, never remove one, so this is promote-only by
 * construction and a wrong answer costs a proof that was not needed rather than a proof that was.
 *
 * "Resolved" is claimed narrowly, because the failure this exists to avoid is not "I don't know" —
 * it is "I know", and being wrong. Every changed file the graph models must be one the index
 * actually holds, or the answer is `unresolved` with the reason named.
