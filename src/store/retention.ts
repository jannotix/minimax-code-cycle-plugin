 * What the store holds and what of it can be given back. Nothing here deletes a record: a candidate

 * stay exactly where they are. Only the retained *bytes* of a candidate's files go, and only for a
 * workflow that has finished — where those bytes are either in the repository, because the
 * candidate was delivered, or deliberately not, because it was cancelled.
 *
 * That is the whole of the policy, and the reason it is safe: `candidate_files.digest` survives the
 * pruning, so what the bytes were remains provable after they are gone. A retention that dropped
 * rows would break the chain this product exists to keep.
